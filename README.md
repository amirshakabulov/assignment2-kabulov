## Favorite team sport: Soccer-Bayern Munich

I like soccer because it is almost everyone's childhood game and almost everyone has good memories associated with the sport. My favorite team in socer is **Bayern Munich** which was founded in **February 27, 1900**. I like this team because of their style and it is my family's favorite team.

### A little bit more about soccer
**Bayern Munich** top three players according to my *opinion* :
1. Manuel Neuer (goalkeeper)
2. Jamal Musiala (midfielder)
3. Maxim Choupo (forward)

Other teams I think would be great to watch, especially playing against **Bayern** are:
* Real Madrid
* PSG
* Manchester City
* Liverpool
